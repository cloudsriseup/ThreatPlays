Threat Hunting is rarely repeatable with predictable outcomes.  This is my attempt to enable threat hunters to take a step in that direction.   

## Getting Started
  
The playbooks are organized into the following fashion:

# Purpose:

# Analysis Techniques:
A simple walkthrough the procedure

# Description
Thorough discussion on the playbook's contents.


# Other Notes
Miscellanous information in parallel

#More Info

## Which tools do the playbooks leverage?
WMIC, Powershell, OSQuery, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Aliyun, Azure, GCP, Carbon Black, Anomali, VirusTotal, Fidelis
